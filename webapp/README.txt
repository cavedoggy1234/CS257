STATUS: The players, teams, and games buttons work and let you see league leaders in 6 catagories by season and month. 
                    When a month is unplayed. The data list is empty because of Covid and a players strike, the months of play in the NBA are inconsistent. 
The teams buttons on the side nav lets you see a teams roster by season, month, their team stastics, and their schedule/results from games played in that month. 
The search players button allows you to search players and see their individual players page individual month/season data. It requires the user to unfortunately select the player name instead of just entering it even if they spelled it correctly.
